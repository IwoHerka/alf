    project(intersect(suppliers_in_london, suppliers_in_paris), [:name])
  comment: |-
    This is NOT intersect(project, project). Indeed, no supplier is both in
    Paris and in London, so the intersection is empty and hence the projection.
    In contrast, two suppliers might have the same name and be one in London
    and the other in Paris. Therefore, projecting first would return those
    two names and the intersection would not be empty.
