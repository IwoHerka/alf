    The projection applies to the heading, that keeps its own order. The
    ordering of fields therefore differs from what could be expected. It's
    not a semantics issue, though.
# empty projection
- alf: |-
    project(suppliers, [])
  sql: |-
    SELECT TRUE AS is_table_dee
    WHERE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM suppliers AS t1)
# empty projection or empty projection
- alf: |-
    project(project(suppliers, []), [])
  sql: |-
    SELECT TRUE AS is_table_dee
    WHERE EXISTS(
      SELECT TRUE AS is_table_dee
        WHERE EXISTS(SELECT * FROM suppliers AS t1))
